✅ Day 1 – React Setup & Component Basics
🎯 Goal:
Understand how React works with components, props, and JSX — the foundation of every React project.

🛠️ Tasks for Today:
1. Setup Your React Project

    Create a new project with Vite (faster) or create-react-app
    Clean up the boilerplate (keep only what you need)

    Organize folder structure like:

        bash
        Copy
        Edit
        /src
        ├── /components
        ├── /pages
        ├── App.jsx
        └── index.css
2. Create Your First Components
 Create 3 basic components inside /components:

        Header.jsx
        Footer.jsx
        Card.jsx (accepts props like title, content, image)

3. Use Props to Pass Data
    In App.jsx, use the Card component multiple times with different data

    Display props inside JSX using curly braces {}


🔍 Bonus Practice:
        Build a small ProfileCard component with the following props:
        {
        name: "Manish Kumar",
        bio: "Aspiring Full-Stack Dev 🚀",
        avatar: "https://i.pravatar.cc/150"
        }
